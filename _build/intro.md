# **About the Author**:
My name is Nolan Strauss and I took this class last semester so I understand many of the problems and difficulties that you may go through as an ME undergrad student. This class can be rough, especially when accompanied by any of your  other ME classes be it partial differential equations or Physics two or whatever. Thankfully though this course is one that will shape the way that you approach problems(hopefully), as it gives you the perspective of the many Numerical Methods that are used every day by engineers all across the globe. This course will show you why to use certain methods and why to use others, it will show you how great these methods are while showing you there pitfalls, and that no method is a "silver bullet" method(works in every situation or solves every problem). Now I realize there may be parts of this book that get a little muddy and confuzing, and I'm sorry unfortunately writing is not where I excel at, but I hope that the interactive sections will help those students who learn best by just toying with something understand the method or idea at hand better than before. If you happen to find any problems or would like to reach out for help understanding a chapter better, you can reach out to me via email(solannauss@gmail.com). No promises on how quickly I will be capable of replying but I'll try my best, I trully do love Numerical Methods and writing computer code, I mean I spent this entire summer writing this online book so I really don't think I need to explain myself anymore. I hope you enjoy this resource and I hope you use it to its fullest capabilities.
