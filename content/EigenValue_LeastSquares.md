# **Eigenvalue Problems **: 

**Methematical Definitions**: First the mathematical definition of an Eigenvalue problem. An Eigenvalue problem, or characteristic problem, are special BVPs that typically consist of oscillating system, vibrations, elasticity etc. These equations are homogoneous linear algabraic systems that are typically found in the form [{A} - Î»{I}] {x} = 0. 

**General Definitions**: The general defintion of an Eigenvalue problem is a homogoneous linear system that shoots to solve for conditions of which a system in oscillation/vibration will meet. 

# **Eigenvalue Problems**:
Eigenvalue problems are some of the more complex mathematical problems that you will come across in this class, but as most of you chould have taken a class covering linear algebra and ODEs you should be well equipped for these problems.
